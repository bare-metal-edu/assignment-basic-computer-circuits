## Introduction

* `2` 74HC02 (`NOR`)
* `1` 74HC04 (`NOT`)
* `2` 74HC08 (`AND`)
* `1` 74HC32 (`OR`)
* `1` 830-pin breadboard
* as many transistors as you want

## Instructions

You must complete and demonstrate this circuit to  an instructor or TL using your breadboard and associated parts. This 
can be done any time during the duration of the assignment until the due date. 

In addition, you must record your findings in the `report.md` file in the `docs/` directory. This documentation will require you to fill
in some truth tables, provide some breadboard layouts, and explain how each of the circuits work, ostensibly. The report also contains
a table for the instructor or TL to fill out when circuits are demonstrated. Again, this table _must be filled out by the instructor
or a course TL_. (This means that you'll have to have `commit`s authored by one of these folks!)

## Assignment "Hack"

> Note: to complete this hack, you will need to request permission to use up to two (2) additional chips. You will
> need to request these of the instructor or a TL and document them in the `Hack`'s `report.md`.

How much work does it take to turn this into a `4` bit combination lock? Do this hack, and you'll find out.
